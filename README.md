# GHG_shiny_app

### What is this project?
Developing a R.Shiny app for visualisation of Scottish greenhouse gas data, building on Gregor Boyd's ShinySparql code.
https://github.com/GregorBoyd/ShinySparql

### What changes have been made so far?
Mainly back-end stuff e.g. filter categories are now auto-generated based upon the data collected from https://statistics.gov.scot.  However, this now allows selection of different greenhouse gases in addition to source sectors.

### Can I join in?
Of course, go wild!  I'm particularly keen to get edits from people well-versed in optimising this sort of R-Shiny code.

### Can I play with the latest version?
