# GHG_shiny_app

## What is this project?
Developing a R.Shiny app for visualisation of Scottish greenhouse gas data, building on Gregor Boyd's ShinySparql code.
https://github.com/GregorBoyd/ShinySparql

## What changes have been made so far?
Mainly back-end stuff e.g. filter categories are now auto-generated based upon the data collected from https://statistics.gov.scot.  However, this now allows section of multiple greenhouse gases in addition to source sectors.

## Can I join in?
Of course, go wild!
